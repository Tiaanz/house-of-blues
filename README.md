# The House of Blues 
Website that generates special features when clicked such as changing colour or playing music.

## Bugs to fix:

## Current features: 
- When page is clicked, background and main title change to random shades of blue.
- When page is clicked the number of times determined by featureTime constant, a random feature is selected using a switch statement with a randomised parameter. 

### heyBaby function 
- selects a random saying to display from the sayingsArray

### etta function 
- plays "I'd Rather Go Blind" by Etta James by inserting an audio HTML tag into the inner HTML of a hidden paragraph function.

## Adding features:
- Feel free to add new features.
- Features are randomly selected by the blueEasterEggs function after a specified number of clicks. 
- To add a feature, increase the numEggs const by 1 and add a case to the switch function with your new feature implemented as a function inside it (see inline comments for guidance).

## Desired features:
- Ability to change volume or stop music 
- Generate a teardrop that falls down the screen from a click point
- Background turn into a grid of blue panels, that each have a randomised shade of blue
